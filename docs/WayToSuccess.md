# Way to Success

To avoid getting lost in the long way, let's write it down, what we want:

1. Create a Shopify public app.
2. Fetch products with a thumbnail.
3. Clicking on the product should show all the images for the product and their file size.
4. A "Compress" button on each image card should compress images to less than 500kb.
5. Click on the image should show you preview, Before and After.
   6 Save button on the image should update that image in the store.
